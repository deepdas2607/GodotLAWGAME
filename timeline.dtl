narrator: You are a lawyer defending the environment in a major case about the pollution of the Ganges River.
narrator: You will be facing off against Priya, a fellow lawyer who believes in balancing the rights of citizens with their duties.
narrator: The judge is waiting for your arguments.
narrator: Make your choices wisely!!
Judge: Counselors, we are here to decide how to address the pollution of the Ganges River.
Judge: Counselor, please begin.
narrator: It’s your time to speak. How do you want to start your case?
- Focus on Rights : Article 21
	narrator: Argue that pollution is violating people's right to life, as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.
	"lawyer 1": Your Honor, the pollution of the Ganges violates the Fundamental Right to Life under Article 21. A clean environment is essential to living a healthy life.
	"lawyer 2": That’s true, but we also need to make sure that people know they have a duty to\
protect the environment. Citizens can’t just rely on the courts they need to\
take responsibility too.
	narrator: Choose your next decision!!
	- Push for Strict Enforcement
		narrator: Argue that the court should take a tough stance and enforce strict laws to stop the pollution.
		"lawyer 1": Your Honor, we need strong court action. Only strict laws and heavy penalties will stop this pollution.
		"lawyer 2": But just punishing people won’t change their behavior. We need to involve citizens and teach them why protecting the environment matters.
		Judge: Counselor, enforcement is necessary, but we can’t ignore the need for public cooperation.
		narrator: The judge decides that your approach is too harsh without involving\
citizens.
		narrator: Priya wins the argument.
		narrator: As you leave the courtroom, you reflect on your choices. Whether you won or lost, you’ve learned that solving environmental problems requires both strong legal actions and public involvement.
		narrator: You lose the case, retry this level for better outcome.
	- Promote Joint Responsibility
		narrator: Suggest that both the courts and citizens work together to solve the\
problem.
		"lawyer 1": Your Honor, I believe we need both court enforcement and citizen involvement. People must be educated about their duty to protect the\
Ganges, but the law also needs to be strong.
		"lawyer 2": I agree. We need to balance rights and duties so everyone does their part.
		Judge: This is a fair approach. I will consider a solution that combines legal enforcement with public engagement.
		narrator: The judge agrees with your approach.
		narrator: The court will enforce laws while also promoting public education.
		narrator: You win the case, and leave the courtroom confident that your\
balanced argument worked.
		Judge: As you leave the courtroom, you reflect on your choices. Whether you won or lost, you’ve learned that solving environmental problems requires both strong legal actions and public involvement.
		narrator: The case may be over, but the fight for the environment goes on. What will you do next?
- Focus on Duties : Article 51A(g)
	narrator: Argue that citizens have a duty to protect the environment under ArƟcle 51A(g), and they need to step up.
	"lawyer 1": Your Honor, under Article 51A(g), citizens have a duty to protect the environment. If people don’t act responsibly, the pollution will continue.
	"lawyer 2": While that’s important, we can’t forget that the state has to protect citizens rights. The government must make sure people have a clean and healthy environment.
	narrator: Choose your next decision!!
	- Support Public Education
		narrator: Argue that the court should order the government to educate citizens about their environmental duties.
		"lawyer 1": Your Honor, I think the government should run a campaign to educate citizens about their duties. If people understand how to help, they will be more likely to take action.
		"lawyer 2": Yes, education can empower people to protect the environment.
		Judge: This is a constructive approach. I will consider ordering a public education program.
		narrator: The judge agrees with your argument.
		narrator: The government will create a public education program, and the law will be enforced.
		narrator: You win the case and feel satisfied with the outcome.
		Judge: As you leave the courtroom, you reflect on your choices. Whether you won or lost, you’ve learned that solving environmental problems requires both strong legal actions and public involvement.
		narrator: The case may be over, but the fight for the environment goes on. What will you do next?
	- Call for Penalties on Citizens
		narrator: Argue that penalties should be given not just to industries, but also to citizens who contribute to pollution.
		"lawyer 1": Your Honor, we should punish not just industries but also citizens who contribute to the pollution. Everyone should be held accountable.
		"lawyer 2": That might push people away from helping. We should focus on educating them first, not punishing them.
		Judge: Penalizing citizens might backfire. Counselor, we need to encourage cooperation not create fear.
		narrator: The judge rejects your idea of penalizing citizens.
		narrator: Priya wins the argument.
		narrator: As you leave the courtroom, you reflect on your choices. Whether you won or lost, you’ve learned that solving environmental problems requires both strong legal actions and public involvement.
		narrator: You lose the case, retry this level for better outcome.
