enforce strict laws to stop the pollution.
		"lawyer 1" (lawyer 1): Your Honor, we need strong court action. Only strict laws and heavy penalties will stop this pollution.
		"lawyer 2" (lawyer 2): But just punishing people won’t change their behavior. We need to involve citizens and teach them why protecting the environment matters.

cooperation.

		narrator: You are going to suggest that both the courts and citizens work together \
to solve the problem
		"lawyer 1" (lawyer 1): Your Honor, I believe we need both court enforcement and citizen involvement. People must be educated about their duty to protect the Ganges, but the law also needs to be strong.

		Judge (New portrait): This is a fair approach. I will consider a solution that combines legal enforcement with public engagement.

elif {response} == "B":
	narrator: You are going to argue that citizens have a duty to protect the environment \
under Article 51A(g), and they need to step up.
	"lawyer 1" (lawyer 1): Your Honor, under ArƟcle 51A(g), citizens have a duty to protect the environment. If people don’t act responsibly, the pollution will continue.
	"lawyer 2" (lawyer 2): While that’s important, we can’t forget that the state has to protect citizens rights. The government must make sure people have a clean and healthy environment.
	narrator: Choose your next decision\
a) Support Public Education\
b) Call for Penalties on Citizens\
Choose between " A " or " B "
	[text_input var="response"]
	if {response} == "A":
		narrator: You are going to argue that the court should order the government to educate citizens about their environmental duties.
		"lawyer 1" (lawyer 1): Your Honor, I think the government should run a campaign to educate citizens about their duties. If people understand how to help, they will be more likely to take action.
		"lawyer 2" (lawyer 2): Yes, education can empower people to protect the environment.
		Judge (New portrait): This is a constructive approach. I will consider ordering a public education program.
		narrator: The judge agrees with your argument. The government will create a \
public education program, and the law will be enforced. You win the case and feel satisfied with the \
outcome.
		narrator: YOU WIN !!
		narrator: The case may be over, but the fight for the environment goes on. What will you do next?
	elif {response} == "B":
		narrator: You are going to argue that penalties should be given not just to \
industries, but also to citizens who contribute to pollution.
		"lawyer 1" (lawyer 1): Your Honor, we should punish not just industries but also citizens who contribute to the pollution. Everyone should be held accountable.
		"lawyer 2" (lawyer 2): That might push people away from helping. We should focus on educating them first, not punishing them,
		Judge (New portrait): Penalizing citizens might backfire, Counselor. We need to encourage cooperation, not create fear.
		narrator: The judge rejects your idea of penalizing citizens, agreeing with Priya’s \
approach. You lose the case.
		narrator: YOU LOSE !!\
